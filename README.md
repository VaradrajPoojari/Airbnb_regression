# Airbnb_regression

A regression problem of predicting `reviews_per_month`, as a proxy for the popularity of the listing with [New York City Airbnb listings from 2019 dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/dgomonov/new-york-city-airbnb-open-data). Airbnb could use this sort of model to predict how popular future listings might be before they are posted, perhaps to help guide hosts create more appealing listings.
